Here is my work for this short Spring Boot and ReST API project.

You can find several HTTP requests in tasks.http and tasksCategories.http that are already ready to be sent (please send them in top to bottom order, otherwise you could have HTTP issues).
Please note that not every use case has been covered in those files, so feel free to try any other request that you might want to.

For your information :  <br> 
Authorization: Basic YWRtaW4xOmFkbWlu refers to admin1 <br>
Authorization: Basic dXNlcjE6dXNlcg== refers to user1 <br>

If you want to use PostMan or to connect to http://localhost:8080/home, here are the different users <br>

| ID     | Password | Role associated |
|--------|----------|-----------------|
| admin1 | admin    | ADMIN           |
| admin2 | admin    | ADMIN           |
| user1  | user     | USER            |
| user2  | user     | USER            |
